🌐 Dark/Light Themed Semantic Webpage

This project is a simple HTML webpage structured using semantic HTML5 elements like <header>, <nav>, <section>, <article>, and <footer>. It features a modern design with a built-in Dark/Light mode toggle button that dynamically switches themes using JavaScript and CSS variables. The layout is clean, responsive, and accessible, making it a great starting point for blogs, portfolios, or educational demos.
